# RSK - R Starter Kit-00

###### Why 00? Because we start counting from zero.

(This is a template repo for everyone doing RSK-00. Feel free to edit it!)

# Welcome

R and Python can be used as alternatives for each other for statistical computing and graphics. Why use R? Here are some reasons:
- It's open source and free
- Runs on all platforms
- It's widely used

Here's a [definitive guide](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/)

## Setup
You have two options:

#### Web:

- Get to this [assignment on Repl.it](https://repl.it/teacher/assignments/4760942) to continue.


#### Local: (On a local computer)

- Install R. Refer to [this link](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/#run-r-programming) depending on your OS.
- <details>
  <summary>Install and run VSCode or any other editor of choice like RStudio</summary>

  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular editor.
  
  Install [R extension on VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r) (optional)

  [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is an alternative.

  </details>

- Clone this repo or copy the contents of main.R into a local main.R. Being able to clone repos and commit changes from the terminal will be an expected knowledge over time ðŸ’ª

## LEARNING
Read through this [semi-tutorial](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/#first-r-program) for foundational knowledge.

## EXERCISE
Submit code that outputs the following:
```
Hello World

My name is Joy.
I am 20+ years of age. Young, right? ðŸ˜ƒ

The maximum number in this list: [12, 4, 56, 17, 8, 99] is 99.
The mean: [12, 4, 56, 17, 8, 99] is 32.666666666666664

A for Apple
B for Boy
C for Cow
...
Z for Zebra
```

With extensive research and reading, try to output this with elegant code. Elegant code here means code that is using descriptive variable names an the language's types and functions. Go beyond just using strings.

See you next week!

## Submit assignment

- You'll be required to update `main.R` with your code from the code editor on repl.it or your local code editor.
